Give me the HTML for the layout of a website.  I will use the terminology "table" because that's how I think of it, but we are doing <div> here, okay?  Here we go:

The "table" is composed of the following, ordered from column 1 starting at the far left, then column 2 is to its right.  There is no margin outside of the table, meaning 0px top, bottom, left, and right.  There is a footer fixed to the bottom of the page, with no offset vertically or horizontally.  This footer is 55px height, 100% width

Column 1 is 80 px width, 100% height, background color black
Column 2 is 1360px width, 100% height
Within column 2:

Row 1 is 65px height, 100% width (meaning width of column 2, not of the whole page, since there's the 80px of column 1 to the left)
Row 2 is 70px height, 100% width of column 2

Row 3 of column 2 is split into 5 columns:
Column 1 of row 3 of column 2 is 30px width, 2000px height, named “Scroll”
Column 2 of row 3 of column 2 is 600px width, 2000px height, named “Feed column”
Column 3 of row 3 of column 2 is 30px width, 2000px height, named “Scroll”
Column 4 of row 3 of column 2 is 690px width, 2000px height, named “X.com column”
Column 5 of row 3 of column 2 is 30px width, 2000px height, named “Scroll”

“Feed column” is split into 4 rows:
Row 1 of “Feed column” is 600px width, 600px height, named “Feed row”
Row 2 of “Feed column” is 600px width, 300px height, named “Highlights row”
Row 3 of “Feed column” is 600px width, 600px height, named “Betting row”
Row 4 of “Feed column” is 600px width, 500px height, named “Podcasts row”

“X.com column” is split into 3 rows:
Row 1 of “X.com column” is 900px height, named “X.com and News”
Row 2 of “X.com column” is 600px height, named “Standings”
Row 3 of “X.com column” is 500px height, named “Reddit and Learn”

The “X.com and News” row is split into 2 columns:
Column 1 is 470px width, named “X.com column within X.com and News row”
Column 2 is 220px width, named “News column within X.com and News row”

The “Reddit and Learn” row is split into 2 columns:
Column 1 is 470px width, named “Reddit”
Column 2 is 220px width, named “Learn”

Row 4 within column 2 is 520 pixels height, 100% width of column 2, and has 4 columns:
Column 1 here is 620px width, 100% height of this row 4
Column 2 here is 30px width, 100% height of this row 4
Column 3 here is 700px width, 100% height of this row 4
Column 4 here is 30px width, 100% height of this row 4

Row 5 within column 2 is 100% width of column 2 and has 3 columns:
Column 1 here is 30px width, 100% height of row 5
Column 2 here is 1300px width, 100% height of row 5
Column 3 here is 30px width, 100% height of row 5

Column 2 within row 5 here has 4 rows:
Row 1 here within column 2 of row 5 is 600px height
Row 2 here within column 2 of row 5 is 600px height
Row 3 here within column 2 of row 5 is 600px height
Row 4 here within column 2 of row 5 is 600px height

Every column here that is 30px in width has a background color of #ed2fe0.  Background color of every other column is white.  

The layout of everything does not resize as the window is resized; this is made to be viewed full screen.  But allow for scrolling vertically.
